This snap consists of necessary lib packages that are required by our apps, including ffmpeg, mpv, etc.

snapcraft upload steps:


Publishing a snap to the **Snapcraft Store** involves several steps, from creating the snap to releasing it publicly. Below is a step-by-step guide:

---

### **1. Install Snapcraft**
Ensure you have `snapcraft` installed on your Linux system:
```bash
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
```

---

### **2. Create Your Snap**
You need a `snapcraft.yaml` file to define your snap. If you don’t have one, generate it using:
```bash
snapcraft init
```
Then, edit `snap/snapcraft.yaml` to define your app (name, version, description, dependencies, etc.).

---

### **3. Build the Snap**
Run the following in your project directory:
```bash
snapcraft
```
This will generate a `.snap` file (e.g., `myapp_1.0_amd64.snap`).

---

### **4. Log in to Snapcraft**
Use your Ubuntu One (or Snapcraft) account:
```bash
snapcraft login
```
Follow the prompts to authenticate.

---

### **5. Register the Snap Name**
Before uploading, reserve a unique name in the Snap Store:
```bash
snapcraft register <your-snap-name>
```
(If the name is taken, choose another.)

---

### **6. Upload (Push) the Snap**
Upload your snap for verification:
```bash
snapcraft upload --release=edge myapp_1.0_amd64.snap
```
- `--release=edge` publishes it to the **edge** channel (for testing).  
  Other channels: `beta`, `candidate`, `stable`.

---

### **7. Test in the Edge Channel**
Users can install it via:
```bash
sudo snap install <your-snap-name> --edge
```

---

### **8. Release to Stable**
Once tested, promote it to **stable**:
```bash
snapcraft release <your-snap-name> <revision> stable
```
(Find `<revision>` using `snapcraft list-revisions <your-snap-name>`.)

---

### **9. Manage Your Snap**
- Update: Modify `snapcraft.yaml`, rebuild (`snapcraft`), and upload again.
- Monitor: Check status at [Snapcraft Dashboard](https://snapcraft.io/dashboard).

---

### **Additional Tips**
- **Automatic Builds**: Use **GitHub Actions** or **Launchpad** for CI/CD.
- **Review Guidelines**: Ensure compliance with [Snapcraft policies](https://snapcraft.io/docs/policies).
- **Debugging**: Use `snapcraft --debug` for verbose output.

---

Your snap should now be available in the Snap Store! �
